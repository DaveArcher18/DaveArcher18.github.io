# David Bowman - Personal Website

This repository contains the code for my personal website showcasing my academic work, publications, workshops, and organizational activities.

The site is structured around the following main sections:
- Home: Introduction and overview
- Writing: Publications and academic notes
- Organization: Events and activities I've organized
- Workshops: Workshops and conferences I've attended
